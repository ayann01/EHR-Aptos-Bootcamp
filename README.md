Introduction
The integration of blockchain technology into electronic health records (EHR) addresses the key issues of security, interoperability, and patient control in healthcare data management. This project uses the Aptos Blockchain to create a decentralized, immutable, and secure EHR system.

Features
Decentralized Storage: Distributed storage of health records across a network of nodes.
Enhanced Security: Cryptographic techniques ensure tamper-proof and secure health records.
Interoperability: Seamless data exchange between healthcare providers.
Patient Control: Patients have full control over access to their health records.
Privacy: Advanced privacy features like zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption.
Transparency: Immutable audit trail for tracking data modifications.
Architecture
The system is built using the following components:

Aptos Blockchain: For decentralized and immutable storage of EHRs.
Smart Contracts: For automating data verification and validation.
Cryptographic Techniques: To ensure data security and privacy.
User Interface: For patients and healthcare providers to interact with the system.
